      <h3>Rear Wheel Drive</h3>
      <p><em>RWD is the drivetrain god intended.</em><br>
        It makes drives <strong>exciting</strong>. RWD cars tend to <u>oversteering</u> during a corner. It's easy to kick the tail of car out and drift your way around a corner. RWD is the go to if you want <strong>performance driving.</strong></p>

      <h4>All Wheel Drive</h4>
      <p><q>It has so much understeer!</q> <small>AWD cars are great for flooring the gas peddle out of a corner, as it has great traction.</small> But it also tends to <u>understeer</u> during a corner. Now some might say this is great for a daily driver. It's safe and predictable, but I say where is the fun in that. Try nailing the apex of a corner with all that understeer!</p>

      <h5>Conclusion</h5>
      <p>In the end, both setup has its pros and cons. Both are safe and reiable options as long as the driver is skilled and understand the different characteristics of each drivetrain.</p>
      <blockquote><strong>But, RWD is the preferred option for professional circuit racing, performance driving and enthusiasts.</strong> Not a fact, only my opinion.</blockquote>
