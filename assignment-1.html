      <h2><strong>Semantic elements summary</strong></h2>
      <p>So, what are Semantic elements? HTML semantic elements describe its meaning to
        the browser and developer. It tells us about its contents. </p>
      <p>Semantic elements have a few things going for them. They are: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Accessible: they help assistive technologies and developers read and interpret a webpage. </li>
        <li>Searchable: they help computers make sense of the content. </li>
        <li>Internationalized: they help non-English speakers understand the document. </li>
        <li>Interoperable: they help other developers understand the structure of the page. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>When building a webpage, developers use a combination of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. HTML is used
        for the basic outline; the organization and content of a webpage. I like to think of it as the
        foundation of a webpage. The semantic elements are what is used to build this foundation.
        They are the base layer; the contents of a webpage. CSS and JavaScript is used on top it
        to make the webpage “prettier”.  </p>
